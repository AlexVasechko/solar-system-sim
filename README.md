An interactive 3D simulation of our solar system built with React and Three.js.

## Features

- Realistic orbital mechanics for planets and moons
- Interactive camera controls
  - Left-click and drag to rotate the view
  - Right-click and drag (or Shift+left-click) to pan
  - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
  - Touch controls for mobile devices (pinch to zoom, etc.)
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Detailed planet and moon system with correct relative sizing and colors
- Saturn's rings visualization
- Star field background

## Interactive Controls

- **Camera Navigation**:
  - Left-click and drag to rotate view
  - Right-click and drag (or Shift+left-click) to pan
